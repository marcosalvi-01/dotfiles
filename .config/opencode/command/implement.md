Implement the previously defined plan. Do it step by step carefully thinking about each step. Write good, simple and effective code. Do not overengineer the code or the process. Write code that is consistent with the patterns and other code in the repository. Make sure to only write code that actually works and fulfills the purpose of the step. Make no mistakes.
