description: Implement a previously defined plan
agent: build

Proceed with the implementation of the previously defined plan. Do it step by step carefully thinking about each step. Write good, simple and effective code. Do not overengineer the code, the process or the logic. Write code that is consistent with the patterns and other code in the repository and follows best practices. When a piece of code or logic is or should be reused make sure to abstract it into a separate component/function/utility, but only when it makes the most sense, do not over-abstract. Make sure to only write code that actually works and fulfills the purpose of the step. Make no mistakes.
